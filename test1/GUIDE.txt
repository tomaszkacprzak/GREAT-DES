This is a guide to running your code on test1.

INPUT

(1) The image data was generated using 
	GREAT-DES/test1_run1/shear_test1.meds.yaml

(2) There are 90 meds files in the 
	GREAT-DES/test1_run1/data/
	Each contains 1024 single exporure images. No segmentation, weights, or badpix are supplied.

(3) Image size is 64 pixels and pixel scale is 0.27 arcsec.

(4) The PSF is a Kolomogorov with fwhm=0.8. In the above directory there is a PSF file, which you 
	can use. You can also use galsim to create it.

OUTPUT - proposed format

(1) One output file per meds file with filename: (example):
		data/profile01ellip00hlr04.meds ---> results/im3shape/profile01ellip00hlr04.meds.im3shape.cat 

(2) Columns for the file: # g1 g2. It would be great if there was an entry for each galaxy in the 
	meds file, Even if your code doesn't output a shear for it for some reason. 
	Flag value of for example 666 can be used for errors.

PLOTS

There is a script in GREAT-DES-REPO/test1/test1_plots.py, which can be used to make plots.
So far it's very basic, so comments and contributions are welcome!


$DESDATA=test1 
${meds_version} = 005
${coadd_run} = run1 
${tilename} = test1
${band} = test1


$DESDATA/meds/005/20130305000001_DES0103-4957/DES0103-4957-i-meds-005.fits.fz

The scheme is

$DESDATA/meds/${meds_version}/${coadd_run}/${tilename}-${band}-meds-${meds_version}.fits.fz
