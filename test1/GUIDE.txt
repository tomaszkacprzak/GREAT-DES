This is a guide to running your code on test1.

INPUT

(1) The image data was generated using 
	sh generate_test1.sh
	which uses REAT-DES/test1_run1/shear_test1.meds.yaml and shear_test1.psf.py

(2) There are 90 meds files in the 
	GREAT-DES/test1/meds/005/run1/
	Each contains 1024 single exporure images. No segmentation, weights, or badpix are supplied.

	using Erins variables to create meds filepath, which is:
	$DESDATA/meds/${meds_version}/${coadd_run}/${tilename}-${band}-meds-${meds_version}.fits.fz
	those can be used:
	DESDATA=/global/project/projectdirs/des/wl/desdata/users/cogs/GREAT-DES/test1/
	meds_version=005
	coadd_run=run1 
	tilename=profile04ellip06hlr20 (example)
	band=test1
	so example filepath would be :
	/global/project/projectdirs/des/wl/desdata/users/cogs/GREAT-DES/test1/meds/005/run1/profile01ellip00hlr04-test1-meds-005.fits.fz


(3) Image size is 64 pixels and pixel scale is 0.27 arcsec.

(4) The PSF is a Kolomogorov with fwhm=0.8.
	There are three ways to get the PSF:
    (1) single PSF file GREAT-DES/test1_run1/meds/005/run1/psf.fits at resolution and pixel_scale the same as the galaxy,
	(2) field of PSFs, all of the same object, but with randomly shifted centers
    (3) high resolution PSF, upsampled by 5, and 4 pixel padding version for im3shape (total image size: (64+4)*5)

OUTPUT - proposed format

(1) One output file per meds file with filename: (example):
		 profile04ellip06hlr20-test1-meds-005.fits.fz --->  profile04ellip06hlr20-test1-meds-005.fits.fz.im3shape.cat

(2) Columns  for the file: # g1 g2. It would be great if there was an entry for each galaxy in the 
	meds file, Even if your code doesn't output a shear for it for some reason. 
	Flag value of for example 666 can be used for errors.

PLOTS

There is a script in GREAT-DES-REPO/test1/test1_plots.py, which can be used to make plots.
So far it's very basic, so comments and contributions are welcome!
